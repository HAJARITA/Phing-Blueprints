I'd like to collect snippets (Cookbook) and whole deployment scripts for Phing. I'd like you to contribute to make this a nice and practical copy/paste resource for Phing scripts.

#Cookbook
This is a collection of short snippets, each solving one problem.

- Install or update a dependency that needs splitting up and renaming. [Source](https://github.com/markushausammann/Phing-Blueprints/blob/master/Cookbook/gitclone-or-gitpull-twitter-bootstrap-into-custom-project.xml)
- Install your dependencies with composer and verify success. [Source](https://github.com/markushausammann/Phing-Blueprints/blob/master/Cookbook/dependency-install-with-composer-and-verify.xml)
- Set environment property in the global scope if not set yet. [Source](https://github.com/markushausammann/Phing-Blueprints/blob/master/Cookbook/how-to-set-environment-if-not-isset.xml)
- Setup a database, populate it with schema and start data. [Source](https://github.com/markushausammann/Phing-Blueprints/blob/master/Cookbook/setupDatabaseAndPopulate.xml)

#Full scripts
This is a collection of full blown multi-target (anonymized) phing scripts, each with a short description of the project context.

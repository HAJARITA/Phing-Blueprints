I'd like to collect snippets (Cookbook) and whole deployment scripts for Phing. I'd like you to contribute to make this a nice and practical copy/paste resource for Phing scripts.

#Cookbook
This is a collection of short snippets, each solving one problem.

- Set environment property in the global scope if not set yet. [[Source](https://github.com/markushausammann/Phing-Blueprints/blob/master/Cookbook/how-to-set-environment-if-not-isset.xml)]

#Full scripts
This is a collection of full blown multi-target (anonymized) phing scripts, each with a short description of the project context.
